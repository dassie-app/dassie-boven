# dassie-boven

This is a bit of a sketch thrown together.
The data is json embedded into the code, which isn't great,
but it was a bit of a POC and it was easier than building offline capabilities
while dealing with http requests.

I've stopped working on this and I'm welcome to anyone else maintaining it.

If you want to take this over, just submit a PR and I'll get in touch.
